## About the Project

This project was commissioned to provide a convenient way to view profitability and expenses reports of each maintenance and construction client. The previous CLI Email Scanner project, provided a system of organization for each one of the projects. All of the PDF information was parsed and stored locally in JSON format. The information was pulled into this application for processing.

The JSON information contains the project name, project address, unique client ID, as well as all of the site visit information and expenses. Separate cost CSV files were created to track the actual cost incurred by the client. Information was broken down on a monthly basis, yearly basis, per client and per client category.
