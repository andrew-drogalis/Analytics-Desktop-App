## About the Project

This project was commissioned to provide a convenient way to view profitability and expenses reports for each maintenance and construction client. The previous CLI Email Scanner project, provided a system of organization and unique IDs for each one of the projects. CLI Email Scanner also parsed the job expense information and stored it locally in JSON format. This project builds off of the information gathered, and provides the data analysis and visualization.

The application displays the project name, project address, unique client ID, as well as all of the site visit information and expenses. Additionally, separate cost CSV files were created to track the actual cost incurred by the client. Information was broken down on a monthly basis, yearly basis, and cumulative basis. This could also be visualized on a per client basis and per client category basis. 

This project was a money saver for the client. In the short term they made resource allocation decisions to not exceed budgets, and in the long term they renegotiated contracts to improve the company's profitability.
